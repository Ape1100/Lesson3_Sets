#Task 1: Flight Route Comparison

#Compare the fligt routes of your airline with a competitor, two sets of flight destinations will be provided for 
#each airline.

#Write a Python program to find out:
#Destinations that both airlines fly to.
#Destinations unique to your airline.
#Whether there are any destinations that neither airline shares.

our_routes = {"LAX", "JFK", "CDG", "DXB"} #our routes 

competitor_routes = {"JFK", "CDG", "LHR", "BKK"} #competitor routes

# Destinations that both airlines fly to
common_routes = our_routes.intersection(competitor_routes)
print("Destinations that both airlines fly to:", common_routes)

# Destinations unique to your airline
unique_routes_ours = our_routes.difference(competitor_routes)
print("Destinations unique to your airline:", unique_routes_ours)

# Destinations unique to the competitor's airline
unique_routes_competitor = competitor_routes.difference(our_routes)
print("Destinations unique to the competitor's airline:", unique_routes_competitor)

# Destinations that neither airline shares
all_routes = our_routes.union(competitor_routes)
destinations_neither_airline_shares = all_routes.difference(common_routes)
print("Destinations that neither airline shares:", destinations_neither_airline_shares)
